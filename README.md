# Matt Ensor

Senior Product Engineer (Frontend) focused on building high-quality product experiences with **React** and **TypeScript**.

I enjoy working end-to-end on customer-facing features, making clear tradeoffs, and building frontend systems that stay fast and maintainable as products scale.

## Current focus
- Interaction-heavy UI systems (canvas/editors, drag/resize, zoom/pan)
- Frontend architecture & performance (rendering, state, virtualization)
- Product-driven engineering: turning ambiguous problems into shippable solutions

## Featured project
- **Palette** — canvas-based editor inspired by Canva/Figma, exploring scalable interaction patterns and rendering performance
